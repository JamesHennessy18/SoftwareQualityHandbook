Software Quality Handbook Plan

After meeting with the team, we have divided the work up between us with a plan in place to complete the work by the deadline

As a group, we must research 5 good quality resources on the following three topics:

1. Task estimation in Scrum
2. Code reviews
3. Dev ops

After discussing with the team, we though that dev ops was a perfect third topic to research for our Software Quality Handbook. As we are a group of three, we found it best that we all work on each of the topics.

Here is how we broke up the work 

James
- I will research and find two quality resources on both Scrum and Code Reviews and one quality resource on Dev ops.
- Although I will work on all three topics, I will do the bulk of the work for "Task estimation in scrum".

Zeynep
- Zeynep will research and find two quality resources on both Scrum and Dev ops and one quality resource on Code reviews.
- Zeynep will also work on all three topics but will do the bulk of the work for "Dev ops".

Franklyn
- Franklyn will research and find two quality resources on both Dev ops and Code Reviews and one quality resource on scrum.
- Franklyn will also work on all three topics but will do the bulk of the work for "Code Reviews".

Things for our group to keep in mind:
1. Try aim for atleast one diagram per topic.
2. Ensure to notify each group member of any pull requests made (Update Via team whatsapp group)
3. Work at a steady pace to have work done a few days before deadline to give the team a chance to review and make any neccessary changes.
