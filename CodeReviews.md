**Introduction to Code Reviews:**

- Code Review is a process where the complete code of a particular software application is dissected into smaller parts, then the parts are reviewed and analysed by senior developers and managers.
- It is a crucial part of the software development life cycle and allows developers to enhance code quality dramatically.
- Tracking errors and spotting early bugs is the main objective of Code Review, which also aims to maintain the cleanest source code possible.
- This process is an essential part of the DevOps cycle and is usually conducted before the QA testing.

# Why should you always Code Review?

-Lets look at some of the advantages of Code Review:

- Early detection of bugs: Reviewing code aids detecting bugs early in the application development process. During the software development process, it is also cheaper to rectify issues in th earlier stages. As a result, code review decreases the overall cost of the software development process.

- Promotes agile development: Agile tesing requires on-time, high quality service delivery. Implementing the code review stage will assist in creating a high-quality product that is free of serious errors and complies with industry standards.

- Tutoring Newbies: If a junior developer has written the software development code, the senior managers should ultimately spend some time reviewing it and providing constructive feedback. The new employee will thus be familiar with the company's standards.

- Team building Activity: The code reviewing activity and feedback session are carried out by sharing information between the senior and junior employees. Employees can learn about their strenghts, areas for improvement etc. through the exchange of constructive criticism in this manner.

**Code review problems:**

- Issues with code reviews can involve not telling the truth, Ego, wrong focus or even rushing it which eventually leads to inconsistencies.

- John Sonmez reveals based on her past experiences that the most effective code review approach is Paired Programming! Paired programming is like just-in-time code reviews. It resolves many of these issues by obtaining a common goal and creating a joint ownership in the code.

Overall the main points that I took from this article were that as you pair up with different members of your team:

1. You are likely to be more honest.
2. You will be less egotistical.
3. Main focus will be the problem itself and not conventions.
4. More analysis will be conducted in general and members can delve deeply into the code.

**Code reviews best practices**

-  Kevin London not only goes into great details about code reviews in general but he also shares his own experiences with them and recommends tasks to be carried out for good code reviews.

The main points that I took from this article to implement good code review practice are:

- **Ask Questions:** How does this method work? If requirements changes, what else would have to change? How could we make this more maintainable?

- **Compliment/reinforce good practices:** One of the most crucial parts of code reviews is to reward developers for growth and effort.

- **Discuss in person for more detailed points:** If I'm discussing a point and it goes back and forth, I'll often pick it up in person and finish out the discussion.

- **Explain reasoning:** It's best to both ask if there's a better alternative and justify why I/he/she think it's worth fixing.

- **Suggest importance of fixes:** Clarifying if an item is important to fix before it can be considered done is useful for both the reviewer and the reviewee. It makes the results of a reviewer clear and actionable.
