# DevOps

**What is DevOps?**

DevOps which is known for Development and Operation's collaboration is a union of working products, working processes and working people.

The process of delivering applications and software services quickly and efficiently is accelerated by DevOps so that businesses can comprehend and adopt the market as soon as possible.

Additionally, it reduces the risk factor through continuous delivery and early feedback from stakeholders and end users.

**How DevOps works?**

Starting from design and development to testing automation and from continuous integration to continuous delivery, the team collaborates to accomplish the desired goal.

To respond rapidly to customer requests and address problems and bugs, people with both development and operations skill sets collaborate and use a variety of CI-CD and monitoring solutions.

**Benefits of DevOps**

Here are the following main benefits of DevOps practices:

- **Break down the Silos:** According to an article by Ankur Mistry he states that the most important benefit of employing DevOps is the ability of the cross-functional development team and operation team to collaborate, made possible by the self-organized working style.

- **Speed:** Faster in pace and multiple frequent deliveries of the desired updates and features will not only fulfill the requirement of the end users but will also assist your organization to take a firm stand in a competitve market.

- **Reliability:** By following DevOps best practices and using the best tool for continuous integration, testing automation, and continuous delivery and monitoring the logs helps the team to stay updated and take the real-time decision rapidly.

- **Team Collaboration:** DevOps enhances the collaborations between the Development team and operations team, team works together towards the specific business goal. DevOps break the silos and focuses on communication, transparency, inspection, adaption and integration.

- **Risk Management:** We can identify the risk factor utilizing this practice at an early stage of the application lifecycle. Staying ahead of the competition requires early detection of any problems or bugs and prompt repair or remedies.

# Challenges to DevOps

Nowadays many software and IT operations teams have adopted DevOps procedures into their work cultures to help them evolve into a quicker and more innovative version of theirselves.

Progress undoubtedly brings challenges and we will explore challenges to DevOps according to a blog by Ruchir Sanghavi.

- **Overcoming the dev versus ops mentality:** Understanding the roles and responsibilities of where dev stops and ops currently begins, and how these can best be integrated together, is a great starting point for any company and this is frequently the first obstacle a company has when adopting DevOps principles.

- **Common understanding of continuous delivery practices:** You need to ask yourself this as a developer, Do your feature teams really understand what it means to continuously deliver your software into environments and at a greater frequency?

- **Implementing a test automation strategy:** Development and operations teams need to ask themselves these questions:

1. How do we do data management for our tests?
2. Can we use open sourced shared libraries and common practices?
3. What does a good end to end test look like for our code base?
4. What should our smoke tests really do?



- **Too much focus on tools:** When implementing DevOps your team members are the most crucial component. Confusion will arise if they are not trained on the newly implemented tools and processes, which will hinder the adoption of the DevOps approaches.

# Conclusion:

This handook provides a detailed analysis on the topics task estimation in scrum, code reviews and DevOps along with challenges that could potentially arise to each of them.

Code reviews have thought us that it can be extremely beneficial and enjoyable when done correctly using one of the appropriate techniques.

Task estimation helps tech companies for proper planning, management and estimation of the total efforts that will be utilised for implementing, testing and delivering the desired product to the end users in terms of time within the specified deadlines.

DevOps has proved to be an essential component because it is a software development and operations approach that enables rapid development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.
