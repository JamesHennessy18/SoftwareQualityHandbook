Code Reviews:
The first article I want to recommend is "Dont snub the code Review" By John Sonmez.
https://simpleprogrammer.com/dont-snub-the-code-review/?utm_content=cmp-true
John goes into detail about the issues surrounding code reviews and then offers an interesting solution which is paired programming.
Take a look!

The second article I want to recommend is "Code Review Best Practices" by Kevin London
https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/05/code-review-best-practices
Kevin not only goes into great detail all about code reviews but also gives his own experience with them and the steps he takes when performing these reviews

Dev Ops:
The Blog post I want to recommend for dev ops is "How one year in DevOps changed my life as a developer" by Noam Kachko.
https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-one-year-devops-changed-my-life-developer
Noam gives great detail about how her new found experience in dev ops affected her life as a developer in relation to quality assurance.
She talks about the things she now does differently due to her one year working in dev ops.
