**Software Quality Handbook**

**Software Quality**
Software quality refers to the overall characteristics of developed software that make it fit for purpose, such as reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and security. Software quality is determined by how well the software meets the requirements and needs of the users, and how well it performs in the intended environment. The software must meet customer or user needs and expectations.

**What is Software Quality Assurance**

Software quality assurance is the process that ensures that software products and services meet the required quality standards and customer expectations. Software quality is not just about lack of defects but also the presence of value. The aim of SQA is to improve the software development process to ensure that the software that is being developed meets the required quality standard. Rather than fixing problems when they occur, we aim to prevent theses problems happening in the development process.

**Importance of Software Quality Assurance**

- It is important to ensure customer satisfaction with the end product in the hopes that customers will continue to use the software and also reccomend it to others.
- Preventing defects early in the development process reduces the cost of fixing them later. With solid SQA, you can catch these defects early before they become larger issues.
- Procductivity is majorly improved when these issues are caught early, it can reduce the time spent and effort needed to fix the issues further down the lin.
- Reducing risk is a major benifit to high standard software quality. Bad software quality can lead to security breaches and loss in data. SQA helps prevent these risks.

ISO/IEC 25010 is a standard that provides a framework for software quality requirements and evaluation. It is attempt to define quality that provides guidelines for software development.

**Our Goals**
 The goal of the handbook is to establish best practices for the team to follow and create a more consistent approach to software development.
 This handbook will cover the following three topics:

 1. Task Estimation In Scrum
 2. Code Reviews
 3. Dev Ops

 When in doubt of anythin related to Software Quality, we advise Software Engineers to refer to our Software Quality Handbook.
 Lets Begin:
