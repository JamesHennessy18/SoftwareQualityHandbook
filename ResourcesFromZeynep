DevOps
My first resource would be "The DevOps Handbook" by Gene Kim, Patrick Debois, Jez Humble, and John Willis.
It was published in 2016 and explains DevOps practices thoroughly.

My second resource for DevOps would be "Continuous Delivery" by Jez Humble and David Farley.
It is ideal to refer for code automation when building, testing, and deployment.

Scrum
The first stop for anyone that is getting started with Scrum would be "www.scrum.org"

A second resource would be "www.appliedscrum.com" which a website that provides free resources for Scrum from ebooks to articles.

Code Reviews
A good resource for code reviews would be the book called "Clean Code" by Robert Cecil Martin.
It is a great book for improving personal coding practices so code reviews can move on faster.
